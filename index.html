        <p>My name is Nathan and I was born in Duluth, Ga. Growing up I loved to play basketball, catch lizards, and go swimming. When I turned seven I moved from Duluth to Berkeley Lake. I went to a private school untill 8th grade. When I transfered to a public highschool it was a big change for me. I went from a school with 200 people to one with 3000! I took me a few months to adjust but I grew to love my highscool. After two years there I began dual enrolement at Georgia State. </p>

        <p>After I graduated from highschool I moved to Lynchburg and began to attend Liberty University. After one semester, I decided the school was not for me so I moved back to Georgia. I then began working full time at Ted's Montana Grill for six months and living on my own. This was a great experience for me because I learned how to manage a full time work schedule and to pay all of my bills. </p>
        <p>While I was living on my own I applied to UGA. I was accepted as a transfer student and I began school in the summer. I moved from Peachtree Corners to downtown Athens. At first it was hard for me to meet people at UGA but as the fall semester started I began to make many more friends and started having a great time. I plan on applying to Terry college in the spring and prusuing a career in business after I graduate.  </p>
